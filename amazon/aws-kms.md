# 2. How to double protect your data using IAM policy and encryption

[Encrypting your data in S3 protects it from unauthorized access in the case somebody gains access to the storage layer. However, you can also introduce an additional policy enforcement point with encryption. Imagine a scenario where read-access to an S3 bucket is mistakenly granted through IAM. If the content is encrypted on the server-side, attempts to read objects will still fail because those users were not granted access to the decryption keys](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/aad9ff1e-b607-45bc-893f-121ea5224f24/en-US/s3/serverside)
