https://serverlessland.com/event-driven-architecture/visuals/understanding-stream-and-discrete-events

What do your consumers need e.g., event filtering/routing, error handling, programming language support,

Streaming events allows you to capture an open ended amount of events/information you may want to act
upon - often the value is not within a particular event, but in the series/group of related events (“high volume, low value“)
