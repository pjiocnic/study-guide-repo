# Difference between Alias and CNAME record

An **alias record** is a Route 53 extension to DNS. It's similar to a **CNAME record**, but you can create an alias record both for the **root domain**, such as **example.com**, and for subdomains, such as **www.example.com**. You can create CNAME records only for subdomains.

# Pricing for ALIAS record

Route 53 doesn't charge for alias queries to interface endpoints or other AWS resources.
