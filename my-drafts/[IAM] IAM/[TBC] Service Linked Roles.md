1. when a service is created it comes along with policies it needs to operate on my resources.  when would I need to create a service linked role?

[CHATGPT]

You're correct that many AWS services automatically create and manage the service-linked roles they need to operate on your resources. These service-linked roles have the necessary permissions predefined by AWS to perform their functions, and AWS manages these roles on your behalf.

However, there are specific scenarios where you might need to create a service-linked role manually:

**When You Might Need to Create a Service-Linked Role:**

**1. Custom Configurations or Advanced Use Cases:**

  * **Different AWS Account:** If you're operating in an environment with multiple AWS accounts, and a service in one account needs to interact with resources in another, you may need to manually create and configure the service-linked role.

  * **Customized Permissions:** If the default permissions provided by the automatically created service-linked role do not meet your specific needs (e.g., you want to limit access further or expand it), you may create a custom service-linked role with the appropriate policies.

**2. Service Doesn't Automatically Create the Role:**

  * **Legacy Services or Older Services:** Some older or less common AWS services may require you to create the service-linked role manually, especially if the service was released before AWS introduced automatic service-linked roles.

  * **Disabled Role Creation:** If you’ve disabled the automatic creation of service-linked roles for some reason (e.g., strict security policies), you may need to create them manually.

**3. Re-Creation of a Deleted Role:**

  * **Accidental Deletion:** If a service-linked role was accidentally deleted, you might need to manually re-create it for the service to continue functioning correctly.

  * **Service Upgrade or Reconfiguration:** During a major service upgrade or reconfiguration, you might need to create a new service-linked role with updated permissions.

**4. Using Services with Specific Role Requirements:**

  * **Service-Specific Roles:** Some AWS services may require service-linked roles with particular naming conventions or configurations. For example, Auto Scaling might require a specific role that has permissions not included in the default role, which you would need to create manually.

**Example Scenario:**

Consider the case where you use AWS Auto Scaling in an account where you’ve imposed strict security controls, and you want to enforce a custom permissions boundary or specific tagging policies on all IAM roles. AWS might not automatically create a service-linked role that meets these requirements, so you’d need to create it manually with your custom settings.

**Summary:**

While AWS services typically manage service-linked roles for you, you might need to create a service-linked role manually when dealing with multi-account configurations, custom permissions, legacy services, accidental deletions, or specific service requirements. This ensures that the role meets your specific security or operational needs.
