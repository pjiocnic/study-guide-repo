Establishing a trust relationship between IAM (Identity and Access Management) and EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) OIDC (OpenID Connect) involves setting up a way for the Kubernetes cluster running on AWS EKS to authenticate users or service accounts using OIDC tokens. This trust relationship is crucial for secure access control and delegation within the AWS ecosystem. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why, how, and what it means to establish this trust relationship:

**Why Establish a Trust Relationship?**

1. Secure Authentication: Ensures that only authenticated users or service accounts can assume roles and access resources.
2. Fine-Grained Access Control: Allows for specific permissions to be granted based on the identity and attributes of the requester.
3. Simplified Integration: Enables seamless integration between Kubernetes and AWS services without managing separate credentials.

**How to Establish a Trust Relationship?**

Establishing a trust relationship involves several steps:

**Create an OIDC Identity Provider in IAM:**

AWS EKS automatically creates an OIDC endpoint for your cluster.
You need to register this OIDC endpoint as an identity provider in IAM.

**Create IAM Roles for Kubernetes Service Accounts:**

Define IAM roles that Kubernetes service accounts can assume.
Configure trust policies for these roles to specify which OIDC provider and conditions are required.

**Associate Kubernetes Service Accounts with IAM Roles:**

Use Kubernetes annotations to associate a service account with the IAM role.
Steps in Detail:
1. Create an OIDC Identity Provider in IAM:
Obtain the OIDC endpoint URL from your EKS cluster. This can be found in the EKS console or using the AWS CLI:
sh
Copy code
aws eks describe-cluster --name <cluster-name> --query "cluster.identity.oidc.issuer" --output text
Create an OIDC provider in IAM:
sh
Copy code
aws iam create-open-id-connect-provider --url https://oidc.eks.<region>.amazonaws.com/id/<eks-cluster-id> --client-id-list sts.amazonaws.com --thumbprint-list <thumbprint>
2. Create IAM Roles for Kubernetes Service Accounts:
Define a trust policy for the IAM role. Example trust policy:

json
Copy code
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
        "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:oidc-provider/oidc.eks.<region>.amazonaws.com/id/<eks-cluster-id>"
    },
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
    "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
            "oidc.eks.<region>.amazonaws.com/id/<eks-cluster-id>:sub": "system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<service-account-name>"
        }
    }
}
Create the IAM role using the trust policy:

sh
Copy code
aws iam create-role --role-name <role-name> --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json
Attach necessary IAM policies to the role:

sh
Copy code
aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name <role-name> --policy-arn <policy-arn>
3. Associate Kubernetes Service Accounts with IAM Roles:
Annotate the Kubernetes service account to associate it with the IAM role. Example YAML for the service account:
yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: <service-account-name>
  namespace: <namespace>
  annotations:
    eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/<role-name>
What It Means to Establish a Trust Relationship?
Establishing a trust relationship between IAM and EKS OIDC means configuring AWS IAM to recognize and trust the OIDC tokens issued by the EKS cluster's OIDC provider. This setup allows Kubernetes service accounts to assume IAM roles securely. It involves:

Trust Configuration: Specifying the OIDC provider and conditions under which the roles can be assumed.
Role Association: Linking Kubernetes service accounts with IAM roles using annotations.
Authentication and Authorization: Ensuring that when a service account in Kubernetes requests to assume a role, the request is authenticated using OIDC tokens and authorized based on the IAM trust policy.
By doing this, you enable secure and fine-grained access control mechanisms that leverage both Kubernetes' native service accounts and AWS IAM roles.
