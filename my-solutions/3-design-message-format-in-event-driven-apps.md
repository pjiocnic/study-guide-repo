# Designing Requests

Designing message formats for event-driven applications is an important aspect of system architecture. When it comes to JSON input and output messages, there are several patterns and best practices you can follow. Here are some key considerations and patterns for designing your message format: [1]

**Consistent Structure:** Maintain a consistent structure across all your messages. This makes it easier for consumers to parse and process the messages. A common pattern is:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "eventType": "UserCreated",
    "version": "1.0",
    "timestamp": "2023-06-15T10:30:00Z"
  },
  "payload": {
    // Event-specific data
  }
}
```

**Event Type:** Include an event type field to allow consumers to quickly determine the nature of the event without parsing the entire payload.

**Versioning:** Include a version field for your message schema. This allows you to evolve your message format over time while maintaining backward compatibility.

**Timestamp:** Include a timestamp to indicate when the event occurred. Use a standard format like ISO 8601.

**Unique Identifier:** Include a unique identifier for each event. This can be useful for deduplication and tracking:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "eventId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    // other metadata
  },
  // ...
}
```

**Schema Definition:** Consider using JSON Schema to define and validate your message structure. This can help ensure consistency and catch errors early.

**Minimal Payload:** Include only necessary information in the payload. Avoid including derived data that can be calculated by consumers.

**Flat Structure:** When possible, prefer a flatter structure over deeply nested objects. This can make the messages easier to process and query.

**Enums for Fixed Values:** Use enumerated values for fields with a fixed set of possible values. Document these enums in your schema or documentation.

**Correlation ID:** If your event is part of a larger process or transaction, include a correlation ID to link related events:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "correlationId": "transaction-123",
    // other metadata
  },
  // ...
}

```

**Source Information:** Include information about the source of the event, which can be helpful for debugging and auditing:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "source": "user-service",
    "sourceVersion": "1.2.3",
    // other metadata
  },
  // ...
}
```

**Extensibility:** Consider including an optional "attributes" or "extensions" field for future extensibility without breaking the core schema.

Here's an example putting some of these patterns together:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "eventId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "eventType": "UserCreated",
    "version": "1.0",
    "timestamp": "2023-06-15T10:30:00Z",
    "source": "user-service",
    "sourceVersion": "1.2.3",
    "correlationId": "signup-process-789"
  },
  "payload": {
    "userId": "user-456",
    "email": "newuser@example.com",
    "registrationType": "EMAIL"
  },
  "attributes": {
    "ipAddress": "192.168.1.1"
  }
}
```

Remember, the specific design of your message format should be tailored to your application's needs. It's important to balance consistency, flexibility, and performance. Also, consider the needs of all potential consumers when designing your message format, as it can be challenging to change once in production.

# Designing Responses

When designing response message formats, especially for handling both successful and error scenarios, it's important to maintain consistency and provide all necessary information. Here's a suggested approach for designing response messages that include correlation IDs, successful payloads, and error information: [1]

**Basic Structure:** Start with a consistent base structure for all responses:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "correlationId": "transaction-123",
    "timestamp": "2023-06-15T10:30:00Z",
    "status": "success" // or "error"
  },
  "data": {
    // Successful response payload or error details
  }
}
```

**Successful Response:** For successful operations, include the relevant payload in the "data" field:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "correlationId": "transaction-123",
    "timestamp": "2023-06-15T10:30:00Z",
    "status": "success"
  },
  "data": {
    "userId": "user-456",
    "email": "<a href="mailto:user@example.com">user@example.com</a>",
    "createdAt": "2023-06-15T10:29:55Z"
  }
}
```

**Error Response:** For error situations, include error code and description in the "data" field:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "correlationId": "transaction-123",
    "timestamp": "2023-06-15T10:30:00Z",
    "status": "error"
  },
  "data": {
    "errorCode": "USER_NOT_FOUND",
    "errorMessage": "The specified user could not be found",
    "errorDetails": {
      "userId": "user-789"
    }
  }
}
```

**Consistency:** Ensure that the correlationId is always included in the metadata, regardless of whether the response is successful or an error.

**Error Codes:** Define a set of standardized error codes that can be used across your system. This makes error handling more consistent and easier for consumers.

**Versioning:** Consider including a version field in the metadata to allow for future changes to the response format:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "correlationId": "transaction-123",
    "timestamp": "2023-06-15T10:30:00Z",
    "status": "success"
  },
  // ...
}
```

**Additional Metadata:** Depending on your needs, you might want to include additional metadata such as the service name, environment, or request ID:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "correlationId": "transaction-123",
    "timestamp": "2023-06-15T10:30:00Z",
    "status": "success",
    "service": "user-service",
    "environment": "production",
    "requestId": "req-abc-123"
  },
  // ...
}
```

**Nested Error Information:** For more complex error scenarios, you might want to nest error information:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "correlationId": "transaction-123",
    "timestamp": "2023-06-15T10:30:00Z",
    "status": "error"
  },
  "data": {
    "error": {
      "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
      "message": "Invalid input provided",
      "details": [
        {
          "field": "email",
          "message": "Invalid email format"
        },
        {
          "field": "age",
          "message": "Age must be a positive integer"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This design allows for consistent handling of both successful and error responses, always includes the correlationId for tracing, and provides detailed information in error scenarios. The structure is flexible enough to accommodate various types of responses while maintaining a predictable format for consumers.

Remember to document your response format thoroughly, including all possible error codes and their meanings, to help consumers of your API or event messages handle responses correctly.
