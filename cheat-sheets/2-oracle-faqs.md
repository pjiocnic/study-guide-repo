To check if all child rows in a specific status in Oracle SQL, you can use a SQL query with a WHERE clause that filters for the desired status and a subquery to count the total number of child rows and the number of child rows in the specific status. Then, you can compare these two counts to determine if all child rows have the specific status.

Here's an example SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT
    parent_id,
    CASE
        WHEN COUNT(*) = SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'desired_status' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
        THEN 'All child rows have the desired status'
        ELSE 'Not all child rows have the desired status'
    END AS status_check_result
FROM
    your_table_name
WHERE
    parent_id = your_parent_id
GROUP BY
    parent_id;
```

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT parent_id
FROM your_table_name
WHERE parent_id IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT parent_id
    FROM your_table_name
    WHERE status = 'desired_status'
);
```

# Describe table

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, data_length, data_precision, data_scale, nullable, data_default, column_id, comments
FROM user_tab_columns
WHERE table_name = 'YOUR_TABLE_NAME';

SELECT table_name FROM user_tables WHERE table_name = 'YOUR_TABLE_NAME';
```

# SELECT FOR UPDATE

in oracle's select for update what happens if the row does not exist?
ChatGPT

In Oracle's **SELECT FOR UPDATE** statement, if the specified row(s) do not exist, Oracle will still acquire a row-level lock on the non-existent row. This behavior might seem counterintuitive, but it's important to understand how **SELECT FOR UPDATE **works.

Here's what happens when you execute a **SELECT FOR UPDATE** statement on a row that doesn't exist:

**Lock Request**: When you issue a **SELECT FOR UPDATE** statement, Oracle will try to acquire a row-level lock on the row(s) that match the criteria specified in the WHERE clause.

**No Matching Rows**: If there are no rows that match the WHERE clause criteria, Oracle will not return any rows as part of the result set. However, it will still acquire a lock on a non-existent row to prevent other transactions from inserting or updating a row that matches the same criteria until the current transaction is committed or rolled back.

**Lock Release**: The lock acquired by the SELECT FOR UPDATE statement will be released when the transaction is committed or rolled back. If no row actually existed to be locked, the lock on the non-existent row has no real effect on the database and will be released without any issues.

It's important to handle the absence of rows gracefully in your application code when using **SELECT FOR UPDATE**. Check whether the result set is empty and take appropriate actions if necessary.

For example, in Oracle PL/SQL, you can use a cursor to fetch the selected rows and then check if any rows were returned before proceeding with further processing:

```sql
Copy code
DECLARE
    CURSOR c1 IS
        SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE some_condition FOR UPDATE;
    -- Declare variables to hold row data here
BEGIN
    OPEN c1;
    FETCH c1 INTO -- your variables here
    IF c1%NOTFOUND THEN
        -- No rows matched the condition
        -- Handle this case accordingly
    ELSE
        -- Process the fetched row(s)
    END IF;
    CLOSE c1;
END;
```

In this example, **%NOTFOUND** is used to check if any rows were returned by the cursor. If no rows matched the condition, you can handle it in the appropriate manner for your application logic.
