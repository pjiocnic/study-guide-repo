To determine the transitive dependencies of a Java project built with Maven, you can use Maven’s built-in tools to view the entire dependency tree, including both direct and transitive dependencies.

Here are a few ways to do that:

### 1. Use the `mvn dependency:tree` Command
The most common way to view the transitive dependencies is by running the `mvn dependency:tree` command from the root of your Maven project. This will output the entire dependency hierarchy, showing both direct and transitive dependencies.

#### Steps:
1. Open a terminal/command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root directory of your Maven project where the `pom.xml` file is located.
3. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   mvn dependency:tree
   ```

This will display the dependency tree, and you’ll see transitive dependencies indented beneath their direct dependencies.

### 2. Use the `mvn dependency:list` Command
You can also use the `dependency:list` command, which lists all dependencies, but it does not show the hierarchy like `dependency:tree`.

#### Steps:
```bash
mvn dependency:list
```
This will give you a flat list of all dependencies, including transitive ones.

### 3. Using IDEs (like IntelliJ IDEA)
If you're using an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA:
- Open your Maven project.
- Navigate to the "Maven" tab or window (usually on the right).
- Expand the `Dependencies` section, which shows all dependencies, including transitive ones.

### Understanding the Output
When you run `mvn dependency:tree`, the output will be in a tree structure. Direct dependencies are listed first, followed by transitive dependencies that are required by those direct dependencies. You’ll see different scopes (like `compile`, `test`, `runtime`) displayed next to the dependencies to indicate how they are used.

For example:
```
[INFO] --- maven-dependency-plugin:3.1.1:tree (default-cli) @ your-project ---
[INFO] com.example:your-project:jar:1.0-SNAPSHOT
[INFO] +- org.apache.commons:commons-lang3:jar:3.12.0:compile
[INFO] |  \- org.apache.commons:commons-parent:jar:48:compile (transitive dependency)
[INFO] +- junit:junit:jar:4.12:test
[INFO] \- org.hamcrest:hamcrest-core:jar:1.3:test (transitive dependency)
```

In this example:
- `commons-parent` is a transitive dependency of `commons-lang3`.
- `hamcrest-core` is a transitive dependency of `junit`.

# Analyze dependencies of a JAR

To analyze the dependencies of a JAR file (which someone has built) directly using Maven isn't straightforward because Maven operates at the project level through a `pom.xml` file. However, there are ways you can work around this limitation:

### Approach 1: Use `jdeps` (Java Dependency Tool)

The `jdeps` tool, which is part of the JDK, can analyze the dependencies of a JAR file, including both direct and transitive dependencies. This tool provides insight into the classes and packages used within a JAR file.

#### Steps to use `jdeps`:
1. Ensure that you have the JDK installed.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   jdeps -verbose:class your-library.jar
   ```

This will display the dependencies of the JAR, including transitive dependencies.

For package-level dependencies:
```bash
jdeps -verbose:package your-library.jar
```

### Approach 2: Create a Dummy Maven Project
If you need to use Maven specifically, you can create a dummy Maven project that uses the JAR as a dependency and then run Maven commands like `mvn dependency:tree`.

#### Steps:
1. Create a new directory for the dummy project and `cd` into it:
   ```bash
   mkdir dummy-project
   cd dummy-project
   ```

2. Generate a new Maven project using the following command:
   ```bash
   mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=dummy-project -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
   ```

3. Copy the JAR file into the `src/main/resources` directory or another appropriate location in your new project.

4. Edit the `pom.xml` file of the generated project to add the JAR file as a system-scoped dependency. For example:

   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>com.example</groupId>
       <artifactId>your-library</artifactId>
       <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
       <scope>system</scope>
       <systemPath>${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/your-library.jar</systemPath>
   </dependency>
   ```

5. Now run the following Maven command to see the dependency tree:
   ```bash
   mvn dependency:tree
   ```

This will show you the dependencies, though it might not be able to fully resolve transitive dependencies unless the JAR was built with proper metadata in place (such as a `pom.xml` or MANIFEST file).

### Approach 3: Inspect the JAR’s `pom.xml` or MANIFEST
If the JAR file contains a `pom.xml` or a MANIFEST file (in `META-INF`), you might be able to inspect it for dependency information:

1. Unzip the JAR file:
   ```bash
   jar -xf your-library.jar
   ```

2. Look inside the `META-INF` directory to see if there’s a `pom.xml` or `MANIFEST.MF` file. These files sometimes contain dependency information (like `pom.xml` for Maven projects or `MANIFEST.MF` for Gradle).

   For example, in `MANIFEST.MF`, you might find:
   ```plaintext
   Class-Path: dependency1.jar dependency2.jar
   ```

This won't always include all transitive dependencies but could give you some useful information.

### Summary
- **For basic dependency analysis**: Use `jdeps` (comes with JDK) to see the dependencies of a JAR file.
- **For Maven-specific analysis**: Create a dummy Maven project, add the JAR as a system-scoped dependency, and use `mvn dependency:tree`.
- **For metadata inspection**: Check if the JAR contains `pom.xml` or `MANIFEST.MF` files for potential dependency details.

# Using `pom.xml` file inside the `META-INF` folder of the JAR

Yes, if you find a `pom.xml` file inside the `META-INF` folder of the JAR, it can provide a lot of useful information about the dependencies, including transitive ones. This is essentially the Maven project file used to build the JAR and it can list dependencies, versions, scopes, and more.

### How the `pom.xml` in `META-INF` Can Help
The `pom.xml` typically contains:
- **Direct dependencies**: These are the dependencies explicitly declared by the author of the library.
- **Dependency Management**: Sometimes a `<dependencyManagement>` section can be present to control versions of transitive dependencies.
- **Plugins and other configurations**: This might include build instructions, repositories, or other build-related configurations.

### What to Look for in the `pom.xml`
Once you've opened the `pom.xml` file, look for the `<dependencies>` section, which will list all of the direct dependencies for that project.

Here’s an example of what it might look like:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>
        <artifactId>commons-lang3</artifactId>
        <version>3.12.0</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>junit</groupId>
        <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
        <version>4.12</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

#### Transitive Dependencies
In the case of transitive dependencies, Maven will automatically resolve them based on the direct dependencies listed in the `pom.xml`. You won’t see them listed explicitly in the `pom.xml` file unless they are important to manage (e.g., version control through `<dependencyManagement>`).

To analyze them further, you can:
1. Copy the dependencies from the `pom.xml` and add them to your own Maven project’s `pom.xml`.
2. Then, run `mvn dependency:tree` in your project, which will resolve not only the direct dependencies but also the transitive ones.

### Steps to Analyze Dependencies from `pom.xml`
1. **Extract the JAR** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   jar -xf your-library.jar
   ```

2. **Locate the `pom.xml`** in the `META-INF` directory.

3. **Inspect the `pom.xml`** file:
   - Open it in a text editor.
   - Look for the `<dependencies>` section to see all declared dependencies.

4. **Use it in your project**:
   If you want to explore further, you can add the dependencies from that `pom.xml` into your own Maven project and run Maven commands (`mvn dependency:tree` or `mvn dependency:list`) to explore transitive dependencies.

### Bonus: Use `mvn install:install-file`
If the JAR is not in any public Maven repository and you want to resolve it properly in your own project, you can manually install the JAR in your local Maven repository with the `mvn install:install-file` command:

```bash
mvn install:install-file \
  -Dfile=your-library.jar \
  -DgroupId=com.example \
  -DartifactId=your-library \
  -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT \
  -Dpackaging=jar \
  -DpomFile=path/to/pom.xml
```

This will allow Maven to treat it like a normal dependency in your project, and it will use the `pom.xml` for any transitive dependency resolution.

### Summary
- **Yes**, the `pom.xml` inside `META-INF` can provide direct dependency information.
- **To see transitive dependencies**: Use the `pom.xml` in your own project or run `mvn dependency:tree`.
- **Optionally**, install the JAR with its `pom.xml` using `mvn install:install-file` to have Maven manage it for you.

# Test scope dependencies

Dependencies that are marked with **test scope** in a Maven project are used only during the testing phase of the project that builds the JAR. They are **not included** when the library is packaged for use in production, nor are they transitively passed along to projects that depend on that library.

So, if the third-party library you are analyzing has dependencies with **test scope** in its `pom.xml`, they **will not affect your project** when you use that JAR as a dependency.

### Key Points about Test Scope Dependencies:
- **Test scope dependencies** are only required for compiling and running the tests of the library itself.
- These dependencies do **not get included** in the final JAR (or WAR) that you depend on.
- When you inspect the `pom.xml` or run Maven commands, such as `mvn dependency:tree`, **test scope dependencies will still show up**, but you can safely ignore them unless you are modifying or running tests on the third-party library itself.

Here’s an example of a `pom.xml` showing a test-scoped dependency:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>junit</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
    <version>4.12</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

### How to Identify Test Scope Dependencies:
- **In the `pom.xml`**: If you see a `<scope>test</scope>` in the dependency section, it means it’s only used for testing purposes.
- **In `mvn dependency:tree` output**: Dependencies marked with `[test]` are test-scoped and do not affect your production build. Example:
  ```bash
  +- junit:junit:jar:4.12:test
  ```

### Should You Be Concerned?
No, you **don't need to be concerned** about test scope dependencies. They won't be included in your runtime classpath when you add the JAR to your project. Only dependencies with `compile`, `runtime`, or `provided` scopes are relevant when using the JAR in production.

### Summary:
- **Test scope dependencies** will show up, but they only apply to testing.
- **You don't need to worry about them** when using the third-party JAR in your project unless you're planning to test or modify the library itself.

If you want, you can filter them out from the `mvn dependency:tree` output by using this command:
```bash
mvn dependency:tree -Dscope=compile
```
This will only show dependencies with compile-time scope and exclude test dependencies.
