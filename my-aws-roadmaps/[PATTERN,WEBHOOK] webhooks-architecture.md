# 1. How Webhook works

2 ways to handle communication with external PSP

There are two ways to handle communications with the external PSP.

**1. Short polling:**

After sending the payment request to the PSP, the payment service keeps asking the PSP about the payment status. After several rounds, the PSP finally returns with the status.

Short polling has two drawbacks:

1) Constant polling of the status requires resources from the payment service.
2) The External service communicates directly with the payment service, creating security vulnerabilities.

**2. Webhook:**

We can register a webhook with the external service. It means: call me back at a certain URL when you have updates on the request. When the PSP has completed the processing, it will invoke the HTTP request to update the payment status.

# 2. AWS Use Case

## 2.1. As a Webhook Producer

1. Event generation: Use EventBridge Scheduler if you can pool for events and send in batches. Does AWS DocumentDB workshop have an example?
1. Filtering: EventBridge Pipes support filtering by matching event patterns.
1. Delivery: Use EventBridge if you want to deliver events outside of AWS using REST API
1. Delivery: EventBridge uses Invocation rate Limit to protect extenranl endpoints from surge in traffic. Example? [AWS re:Invent 2019: [REPEAT 2] I didnâ€™t know Amazon API Gateway did that (SVS212-R2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfJZc3sJZ8E)
1. Provides scalable and resilient delivery using SQS: Possible to setup Eventbridge to handle retries with exponential backoff and then send them off to SQS DLQs.

# 3. Architecting a Webhook consumer

1. API Gateway can be an endpoint to receive messages

2. API Gateway can be configured for rate and burst limits.  This way you can protect your downstream systems from being overwhelmed.

3. **Authorization and Verification:**

- **Approach 1** - Using Hash-based Message Authentication Code (**HMAC**): A shared secret is established and stored in Secrets Manager. A Lambda function then verifies integrity of the message, processing a signature in the request header. Typically, the signature contains a timestamped **nonce** with an expiry to mitigate replay attacks, where events are sent multiple times by an attacker
- **Approach 2**: if the provider supports OAuth, consider securing the API with Amazon Cognito.

4. **Handling different Webhook Provider Payload Sizes**:

- Above limits can present a bottleneck.  So use [**claim check-pattern**](https://serverlessland.com/event-driven-architecture/visuals/claim-check-pattern)
- If **claim-check-pattern** is used the you can go upto 6MB since Lambda's payload restriction will only be the limiting factor

4. **Idempotency**: There's possibility that webhook provider submits the same request multiple times (ie at-least-once instead of exactly-once).  To handle this use **Lambda + Dynamodb** to implement idempotency.

5. **Message Ordering**: Since the provider can submit messages out of order (for example when they submit the same message again and again) then you need to use **DynamoDBStreams and eventbridge pipes** to do best effort ordering. To indicate order, events may include a timestamp or a sequence identifier in the payload. If the provider doesn't provide any field to indicate order then use best effort basis.  If a field is provided use  DynamoDB Streams and EventBridge Pipes to create an order.
